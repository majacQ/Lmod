Lmod 8.5+
   (8.5.1)  * Issue #513:  module avail <name1> <name2> ... now only prints matching aliases.  Search names are resolved.
              Tests added to the rt/modulerc directory.
   (8.5.2)  * Failed to register new version with github.  Pushing a new version to fix that.
W.I.P:
   (8.5.3)  * Issue #515: Set LMOD_VERSION for fish shell
            * Add link to isVisible() hook in documentation for hide_version() function.
